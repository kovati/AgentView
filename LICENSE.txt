Under no circumstances shall Licensee enable the use or activation of any Avaya Intellectual Property by an end user, without such end user having acquired the additional necessary licenses to the Avaya Intellectual Property.

3.10 Termination of License. Avaya may terminate these Technology License Terms by giving written notice, effective immediately, if within ten (10) business days of your receipt of a reasonably detailed written request to cure, you have not cured all breaches of license limitations or restrictions. Upon such termination, you will immediately pay all outstanding license fees (including applicable termination charges), cease use of all software, return or delete, at Avaya’s request, all copies of the software in your possession, and certify compliance with all of the obligations in this paragraph to Avaya in writing.

4.  No Warranty.  AVAYA AND ITS SUPPLIERS SPECIFICALLY AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. THE AVAYA TECHNOLOGY IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OR SUPPORT WHATSOEVER. 

5.  Limitation of Liability.  EXCLUDING SECTION 3 (LICENSE GRANT) AND SECTION 6 (INDEMNIFICATION), TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY OR ITS RESPECTIVE SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS TECHNOLOGY LICENSE AGREEMENT OR USE OF THE AVAYA TECHNOLOGY OR ANY DELIVERABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART, OR FOR THE LOSS OF DATA, INFORMATION OF ANY KIND, BUSINESS, PROFITS, OR OTHER COMMERCIAL LOSS, HOWEVER CAUSED, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.  EXCLUDING SECTION 3 (LICENSE GRANT) AND SECTION 6 (INDEMNIFICATION), TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL A PARTY’S CUMULATIVE TOTAL LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS TECHNOLOGY LICENSE AGREEMENT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00). THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS SPECIFIED IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY PROVIDED IN THIS TECHNOLOGY LICENSE AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ALSO WILL APPLY TO ANY LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS AND SUPPLIERS. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6.  Indemnification.  Licensee agrees to indemnify Avaya and its officers, directors, employees, affiliates and agents against, and hold each of them harmless from any and all costs, expenses, liabilities and claims arising from Licensee’s use or distribution, either directly or indirectly, of any Permitted Modifications.  

7.  No Endorsement. Neither the name Avaya, its affiliates or the names of contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Avaya Technology without specific prior written permission from Avaya.

8.  High Risk Activities. The software is not fault-tolerant, and is not designed, manufactured or intended for use or resale as on-line control equipment or in hazardous environments requiring failsafe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or aircraft communications systems, mass transit, air traffic control, direct life support machines, dedicated emergency call handling systems or weapons systems, in which the failure of the software could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage ("high risk activities"). If you use the software for high risk activities, you do so at your own risk and you assume all responsibility and liability for such use to the maximum extent such limitation or exclusion is permitted by applicable law. You agree that Avaya and its suppliers will not be liable for any claims or damages arising from or related to use of the software for high risk activities to the maximum extent such limitation or exclusion is permitted by law. 

9. Miscellaneous.  These Technology License Terms will be governed by New York State laws, excluding conflict of law principles and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.  If a dispute cannot be settled by good faith negotiation between the parties within a reasonable period of time, it must be finally settled upon request of either party by arbitration to be held in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by a single arbitrator appointed by the parties or (failing agreement) by an arbitrator appointed by the President of the International Chamber of Commerce (from time to time).  The arbitration will be conducted in the English language, at a location agreed by the parties or (failing agreement) ordered by the arbitrator.  The arbitrator will have authority only to award compensatory damages and will not award punitive or exemplary damages. The arbitrator will not have the authority to limit, expand or otherwise modify the Technology License Terms.  The ruling by the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Avaya and you will each bear its own attorneys' fees associated with the arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Avaya shall be entitled to take immediate legal action where required to protect its confidential or proprietary information, or to obtain any interim injunction. If any provision of these Technology License Terms is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, these Technology  License Terms will not be rendered unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and the provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision within the limits of applicable law. The failure to assert any rights under the  Technology License Terms, including, but not limited to, the right to terminate in the event of breach or default, will not be deemed to constitute a waiver of the right to enforce each and every provision of the Technology License Terms in accordance with their terms.  You will not export or re-export the Avaya Technology or any other technical information provided under these Technology License Terms in any form in violation of the export control laws of the United States of America and of any other applicable country. For more information on such export laws and regulations, you may refer to the resources provided in the websites maintained by the U.S. Commerce Department, the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control.

If you are a resident of Canada, the following will also apply:

Please note that this Section refers to U.S. export and re-export controls in connection with U.S.-origin products and, therefore, does not raise issues under Canada's Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act.

Les parties aux présentes confirment leur volonté que cette convention, de même que tous les documents, y compris tout avis, qui s'y rattachent, soient rédigés en langue anglaise.   Las partes ratifican que es su voluntad que este Contrato, así como cualquier otro documento relacionado con el mismo, incluyendo todo tipo de notificaciones, han sido redactados y deberán continuar siendo redactados únicamente en el idioma inglés.
